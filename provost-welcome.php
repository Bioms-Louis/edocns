            <p>Welcome to Edo State College of Nursing Sciences, a citadel of academic excellence. With a rich heritage dating back to 1954, we strive to create an enviable niche in health care, preserve the integrity and reclaim the pride of Edo State. </p> 
            <p>We thank His Excellency, Governor Godwin N. Obaseki for rebuilding and upgrading the institution, making it one of the best in Nigeria and beyond. </p>
            <p>We have a robust and all-encompassing curriculum, which is congruent with the provisions of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria and other accrediting bodies. EDOCNS empowers its faculty, staff, and students by providing the knowledge, skills, as well as core values to enable them to be first among equals, while making contributions to the Nursing profession and the society.</p>

            <p>We invite you to take a virtual and in-person tour of our facility. Once again, welcome to EDOCNS, please do support our vision!</p>
